**Auditory grouping**

- Interaural time-differences (the time difference between two ears), which are crucial in determining audio source location, are less important for stream segregation.
- Pure tones:
  - Miller & Heise: 15% change in frequency is enough to separate a trill of 100ms notes into 2 streams.
  - Noorden: extends the work of Miller & Heise; shows that attention control can enforce separation.
  - Bergman & Campbell: sequences of notes can break into streams depending of pitch difference; impossible to judge the temporal order of notes across streams.
- Other examples that result in streaming involve complex tones (the Wessel illusion), dynamics (attack duration) and changes in spatial location.
- Deutsch: grouping by fundamental frequency dominates grouping by spatial location.
- "...Continuity of timbre, pitch, and spatial location are important for maintaining the perceptual integrity of sound source over time" - Gestalt principle.

_Not as clear as Deutsch 2013._

## Deutsch 2013

**The Psychology of Music, Chapter 6**

### Complex tones

Two main ways to segregate spectral component (non-sequential): harmonicity and onset synchronicity.

- Prefer continuity whenever possible.
- Frequency modulation (vibrato) helps to fuse components together. Amplitude modulation also helps, but less.
- We are not relying on first order spatial cues (amplitude / phase / time-differences between ears). But other components can affect and "trick" our spatial recognition.
- Repetitions.

### Sequences

Processing sequential streams depends on, in descending order:

- Pitch proximity.
- Temporal proximity.
- Timbre proximity (Gestalt principle of similarity).
- Minor effect of streaming by amplitude (Van Noorden 1975), amplitude modulation (Grimault et al. 2002) and short-term memory (Roger & Bergman 1993).

Properties of sequential streaming:

- Streaming is builds up by repetitions and can be "reseted".
- Impossible to judge the temporal relationships of notes across streams (Van Noorden 1975).
- Attention can affect streaming (Van Noorden 1975, Carlyon et al. 2001 & 2003).

### Grouping monophonic melodies (musical structure - see criticism)

Most important cues for structural grouping, in descending order:

- Temporal proximity (Deliege 1987, confirming Lerdahl & Jackendoff theory).
- Pitch proximity (Deutsch 1978, Hamaoui & Deutsch 2010).

### Grouping of simultaneous tone sequences (miscellaneous effects)

- The scale illusion: very similar to the Wessel illusion when timbre is mapped to spatial information.
- The octave illusion (see figure).

### Criticism

I don't think that there is a connection between our ability to group notes to motives and phrases and our ability to separate audio sources. It is weird that the author deals with both in the same chapter.

Other researchers start from sequences of pure tones. Deutsch starts from complex tones and move to sequences - which is nice!

# Auditory Stream Segregation and Fusion

## Bergman & Campbell 1971

**Pimary auditory stream segregation and perception of order in rapid sequences of tones**

### Experiment 1

Sequence of 6 pure tones of 100ms in 2 triplets, one of high freq notes and one of low freq notes.

**Independent variable:** order of 6 tones.
**Dependent variable:** ability to assign the notes labels in the correct order.

 Participants are unable to judge the temporal ordering across the streams.

### Experiment 2

Fixes experiment 1 dependency on memorizing note labels by using pattern recognition: standard loop contains 3 tones and 3 gaps. Comparison loop contains 6 notes. Participants need to judge if the standard loop is a subset of the comparison loop. Similar results.

## Dowling 1973

**The Perception of Interleaved Melodies**

### Experiment 1

Identification of interleaved pairs of familiar melodies is possible if their pitch ranges do not overlap, but difficult otherwise.

### Experiment 2

Playing a reference melody and than interleaving a "background" melody with reference or different melody. According to authors the background interferes with same-different judgments regardless of the separation of their pitch ranges, but that range separation attenuates the interference effect. Actually, the only significant effect is of pitch separation and that performance at 0 separation was better than chance.

### Experiment 3

When pitch ranges overlap, listeners can overcome the interference effect and recognize a familiar target melody if the target is pre-specified, thereby permitting them to search actively for it.

### Experiment 4

Familiarity or pre-specification of the interleaved background melody appears not to reduce its interfering effects on same-different judgments concerning unfamiliar target melodies.

### Criticism

Best abstract ever!

Check experiment 2 validity and conclusions.

# Statistical Learning of Grouping Structure

## Saffran et al. 1999

**Statistical learning of tone sequences by human infants and adults**

### Experiment 1

11 chromatic 1/3 second pure tones are syllables. For each of 2 languages 6 "tone words" are created, each one from 3 syllables. 6 sentences are composed from 18 words each. These are concatenated to create 7 minute "tone story" for each language. Note that there is no mark for word / sentence boundary!

After listening to the "tone story" 3 times, each participant...

**Independent variable:** listening to 36 pairs of words, one from the language and one not.
**Dependent:** which one was from the language.

![Saffran et al. 1999 - experiment 1](media/saffran1999.png)

### Experiment 2

Similar to experiment 1. The non-words are now drawn from a language that all of it's words are part-words of the language that used for training. A part-word is a word from the language when it's first syllable or last syllable was changed. The results are very similar to the results of experiment 1. Less extreme but still significant.

### Experiment 3

Similar to experiment 1 but with 8-month-old infants. Same results.

### Conclusions

All experiments show results very similar to those of learning spoken languages.

_Amazing!_
